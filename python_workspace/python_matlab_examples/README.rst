contourImage2.m                 hack to work around Matlab R2014b/R2015a removal of contour(), contourf() and contour3() handle graphics children that formerly could be used to move contours into a 3-D plot. This workaround first plots the image at z=0, and the contour at z=0, then flattens the figure to an image and resizes to the original data, allowing the new pcolor joint plot to be arbitrarily placed in 3-D.
R2014bAxesMultiColormap.m       showing the new capability of Matlab R2014b/R2015a to have independent colormaps and colorbars -- freezeColor from Matlab Central is NOT necessary as with earlier versions of Matlab.
